<h1>stockZ</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>StockZ is a full stack clone of the e-commerce site called stockX. The site was
built using a Ruby on Rails backend, a PostgreSQL database, and a JavaScript React/REdux frontend.</p>

<p>On stockZ, users that are signed in are able to add, update, and remove items from their 
shopping cart.</p>

<h2>Technologies</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The frontend is coded in JavaScript</li>
  <li>React and Redux were used to render components and manage state</li>
  <li>Ruby was used on the backend to code routes, models, and controllers</li>
  <li>A rails framework tied this code to a PostgreSQL database</li>
</ul>
